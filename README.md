# SimpleSchnorrSignature

This repository contains a basic Python implementation of Schnorr signatures, leveraging the ECDSA library. The implementation includes the generation of private and public keys, signing a message, and verifying the signature.

## Disclaimer
This implementation is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production or for secure cryptographic applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- ECDSA library (install with `pip install ecdsa`)

## Usage
Run the script to see an example of key generation, message signing, and signature verification. You can modify the `message` variable in the script to test different messages.
